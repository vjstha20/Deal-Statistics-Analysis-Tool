The provided code implements the entire ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, analysis process, and visualization process for the Deal Statistics Analysis Tool project.

1. ETL Process

Extract:

Data is loaded from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.

Transform:
Missing values are forward-filled.
Duplicates are removed.
Date columns are converted to datetime format.
Debt-equity ratio is calculated.

Load:

Cleaned data is saved back to new CSV files in the 'data/processed' directory.
2. Analysis Process

Merge Data:

Deal statistics data is merged with industry averages.

Calculate Metrics:

Peers multiple is calculated by dividing the debt-equity ratio by the average debt-equity ratio for the industry.

Save Results:

The analysis results are saved to a CSV file in the 'data/processed' directory.
3. Visualization Process

Create Visualizations:

Line plot of debt-equity ratio over time.
Bar plot of peers multiples by industry.

Save Visualizations:

Visualizations are saved as PNG files in the 'reports' directory.
